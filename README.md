# My Random Projects - Soli Deo Gloria

## Why did I created this repository?

I created this repository to record the projects I will do along this year in Soli Deo Gloria Campus. Here I'm learning git, markdown, HTML, CSS, Java Script, docker, etc. And I want to record all my learning progress for my personal use. In this repo, I will emphasize HTML's, CSS's and Java Script's projects.

## What did I specifically want to record?

1. Projects From the FreeCodeCamp's Java Scritp course;
    1. A text pyramid;
    2. Using an API;

1. Some random Js projects;
    1. A calculator;

## Some random code I want to unterstand :D

```
//Ordering number in a array

array.sort(function(a,b){
return a-b
}
```
